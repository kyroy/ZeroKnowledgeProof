\maketitle

Usually, proving the knowledge of a solution for a problem requires the disclosure of the solution itself, or at least parts of it.
Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff define zero-knowledge proofs ``as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question''~\cite{goldwasser1989knowledge}, here the knowledge of a solution.
Most of the existing zero-knowledge proofs are interactive, meaning they are protocols between two parties, where the \emph{prover} tries to convince the \emph{verifier} by responding to challenges the verifier formulates for encoded solutions of the prover\todo{split up}.
Since this method is mostly no guarantee of the prover's claim, this process may be repeated multiple times to significantly reduce the chance that the prover is trying to cheat.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform where smart contracts can be executed.
By validating the input, different actions are possible.
So a solution for a problem can be verified before the proposer is being paid.
But to do so, data is stored in the blockchain and you also have to pass the solution to it.
This means, that the data is publicly available and can be (mis)used by everyone.
Especially when considering the proof of identity, you do not want to send the required information to a public channel.
This is where zero-knowledge proofs can be used to keep privacy and ensure security.

In this thesis, I will validate the possibility of implementing different zero-knowledge proofs on the Ethereum blockchain.
This includes protocols, like the Feige-Fiat-Shamir identification scheme \cite{feige1988zero}, a well-known zero-knowledge proof that uses modular arithmetic, as well as 
ring signatures which are stated as ``extremely promising for both token anonymization and identity applications'' \cite{buterin2015public} by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.
Moreover, I will look closely at the existing zero-knowledge proof by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff \cite{goldreich1991proofs} for the NP-complete graph 3-coloring problem, thus the zero-knowledge proofs for all problems in NP.
